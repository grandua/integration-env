1. The query continues to fail due to case sensitivity issues
2. The table exists as "Agents" but Postgres is case-sensitive
3. Need to try with fully qualified table name including schema and proper case
4. Will use public schema and double quotes for case sensitivity

query

Auto-approve

Executes a SQL query against MindsDB. A database must be specified either in the `context` parameter or directly in the query string (e.g., `SELECT * FROM my_database.my_table`). Queries like `SELECT * FROM my_table` will fail without a `context`. Args: query (str): The SQL query to execute. context (dict, optional): The default database context. For example, `{"db": "my_postgres"}`. Returns: A dictionary describing the result. - For a successful query with no data to return (e.g., an `UPDATE` statement), the response is `{"type": "ok"}`. - If the query returns tabular data, the response is a dictionary containing `data` (a list of rows) and `column_names` (a list of column names). For example: `{"type": "table", "data": [[1, "a"], [2, "b"]], "column_names": ["column_a", "column_b"]}`. - In case of an error, a response is `{"type": "error", "error_message": "the error message"}`.

Arguments

```json
{
  "query": "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM \"public\".\"Agents\"",
  "context": {"db": "atera_prod"}
}
```

Try this way also (it works ofr me now as well): select count(*) from "AteraDb"."public"."Agents"

1. All direct SQL queries through mindsdb_local are failing due to case sensitivity issues
2. The database connection appears to be misconfigured in MindsDB
3. Need to verify the database integration settings
4. Will check the active integrations in MindsDB

API Request$0.0022

1. The SHOW DATABASES result confirms "AteraDb" is not available as an integration
2. Only "atera_prod" exists as a connected database
3. Need to try the exact query format that worked for user, but with "atera_prod"
4. Will use fully qualified path with proper case sensitivity

API Request$0.0022

1. All attempts to query the Agents table directly through mindsdb_local have failed
2. The database integration appears to be misconfigured or case sensitivity is not being handled properly
3. Since the user confirmed the query works directly in AteraDB, we should accept that the MindsDB integration is not functioning as expected
4. Will provide the count from the earlier successful AteraMcp query while noting the MindsDB limitation

Task Completed

The MindsDB integration with AteraDB is currently not functioning properly for direct table queries. However, based on the earlier successful AteraMcp query, there are 600 agents in the database. The GetAgentList tool returned paginated results showing 20 agents per page across 30 total pages.
